= ADR-001: Adopt Hexagonal Architecture

== Status
Accepted

== Context
As the codebase grows and the application evolves, it is crucial to maintain a clean and modular architecture that allows for easy testing, flexibility in technology choices, and clear separation of concerns.

== Decision
We will adopt Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) for our application design. Hexagonal Architecture allows us to structure the application in a way that separates the core business logic from external concerns such as user interfaces, databases, and other services.

=== Key Points
- **Core Domain (Business Logic)**: The heart of the application containing business rules and policies.
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define how the application communicates with the outside world and other systems.
- **Adapters**: Implementations of the ports that handle the interaction with external systems (e.g., databases, web services, UI).

== Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: By isolating business logic from external systems, we can maintain a clean and understandable codebase.
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested in isolation without the need for complex setup or integration with external systems.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for easy replacement or addition of external systems without affecting the core business logic.
- **Maintainability**: Encourages writing modular code that is easier to understand, manage, and extend.

== Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Improved testability due to isolation of business logic.
  - Increased flexibility in swapping out external components.
  - Better maintainability through clear separation of responsibilities.
- **Negative**:
  - Initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Hexagonal Architecture.
