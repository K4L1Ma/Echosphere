= ADR-002: Adopt gRPC Streams

== Status
Accepted

== Context
Our application requires efficient and real-time communication between services to handle high-frequency data updates and maintain synchronization. Traditional HTTP-based REST APIs have shown limitations in handling bi-directional streaming data efficiently. We need a robust solution that supports streaming capabilities to enhance performance and scalability.

== Decision
We will adopt gRPC Streams for communication between clients and servers. gRPC Streams provide efficient, low-latency communication with built-in support for bi-directional streaming, making it suitable for real-time data exchange scenarios.

=== Key Points
- **Unary RPC**: Standard request-response model.
- **Server Streaming**: Server can stream a sequence of responses after a single client request.
- **Client Streaming**: Client can send a sequence of requests and receive a single response.
- **Bi-Directional Streaming**: Both client and server can send a sequence of messages to each other using a single, long-lived connection.

== Rationale
- **Performance**: gRPC uses HTTP/2, which provides features like multiplexing, header compression, and low latency, making it more efficient than traditional HTTP/1.1.
- **Streaming Support**: Built-in support for various streaming patterns (server, client, and bi-directional), which are essential for our real-time data requirements.
- **Strongly Typed Contracts**: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for defining service contracts, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of communication errors.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: gRPC supports multiple programming languages, facilitating interoperability between services written in different languages.

== Consequences
- **Positive**:
- Enhanced performance and scalability for real-time data communication.
- Simplified implementation of complex streaming scenarios.
- Strongly typed interfaces improve reliability and maintainability.
- **Negative**:
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with gRPC and Protocol Buffers.
- Initial setup and configuration effort required for transitioning to gRPC.

== Alternatives Considered
- **HTTP/1.1 REST APIs**:
- Pros: Familiarity, simplicity, and wide adoption.
- Cons: Limited support for real-time streaming, higher latency, and no built-in support for bi-directional communication.
- **WebSockets**:
- Pros: Bi-directional communication and real-time updates.
- Cons: Lack of standardization for message formats, higher complexity in implementation, and not as efficient as gRPC in handling streaming data.
- **GraphQL Subscriptions**:
- Pros: Real-time updates and flexible query capabilities.
- Cons: Higher complexity, especially for bi-directional streaming, and performance concerns compared to gRPC.
